There's something about returning to the Brontës that feels like coming home. Not to a place, exactly, but to a state of mind — one where the weather matters, where feeling deeply isn't a flaw, and where the landscape itself becomes a character.

## The First Time

I first read *Jane Eyre* when I was sixteen. I didn't understand half of it, but I understood Jane. Her quiet refusal to be less than herself. Her insistence on her own worth, spoken into a room that didn't want to hear it:

> "I am no bird; and no net ensnares me: I am a free human being with an independent will."

That line rewired something in me.

## Coming Back

Re-reading is an underrated practice. We assume we know a book because we've read it once, but we're different people each time we return. The text hasn't changed — we have.

When I re-read *Wuthering Heights* in my thirties, I no longer romanticised Heathcliff. I saw the damage. I saw the cycle. And I saw, for the first time, how Brontë herself saw it too — she wasn't celebrating obsession, she was dissecting it.

## Why This Matters for Self-Growth

Literature gives us a safe space to explore difficult emotions. We can sit with grief, anger, longing, and jealousy through characters, without the real-world consequences. It's a kind of rehearsal for the inner life.

This is at the heart of my practice: using great literature as a mirror, a map, and sometimes a medicine.
